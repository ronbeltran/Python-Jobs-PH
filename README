Python Jobs PH http://pythonjobsph.appspot.com/

This is the source of my early pet project using native Django on Google Appengine
via Django-Nonrel. I noticed the source is just laying around in my HD gathering dust :-).
So I put it up on the net for future references.

TODO:

Update the code to run on Python 2.7 Runtime
Or rewrite everything in plain and deploy to Heroku since orignal developers already abandoned django-nonrel project.
