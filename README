Python Jobs PH http://pythonjobsph.appspot.com/

This is the source of my early pet project using native Django on Google Appengine via Django-Nonrel. I noticed the source is just laying around in my HD gathering dust :-).
So I put it up on the net for future references.

TODO:

Make the code run on local development
Update the code to run on Python 2.7 Runtime
Or rewrite everything in plain Django and deploy to Heroku since orignal developers already abandoned django-nonrel project.
